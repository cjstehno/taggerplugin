Eclipse Tagger Plugin
---------------------

This was an Eclipse plugin that provided file content tagging functionality.
It has not been developed in quite a while and will most likely not work in the current version of Eclipse.

If you are interested in working on this project please let me know.

The original projects for the plugin have been condensed here for simple archiving.

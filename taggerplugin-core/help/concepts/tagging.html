		<h1>Tagging</h1>

		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<p>Tagging is the act of applying tags to resources. You create and maintain a set of tags per workspace. As you create and manage
		resources in that workspace you can apply a tag or tag(s) to each resource so that the resource may be managed with other similar
		resources through the use of the semantic tagging.</p>

		<p>You can tag resources in any way that you wish. You can create tags based on where the resource fits into your system or for the
		role that the resource plays in your architecture. The tags need not even be that universally meaningful; your tags could simply
		be the names of the developers on your team.</p>

		<h2>Associations</h2>

		<p>Applying a tag to a resource is called associating a tag. You can add a tag association to selected resource(s) by right-clicking on
		the selected resource(s) and selecting the "Add Tag Association(s)" option from the Tags menu.</p>

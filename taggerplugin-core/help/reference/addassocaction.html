		the user to associate one or more tags with the selected resource(s). When this action is fired, a tag selection dialog will be opened
		containing only tags that are not already associated with all of the selected resources (tags that are only associated with some of the
		selected resources are shown). The user then selects the tag association(s) to be added.</p>
